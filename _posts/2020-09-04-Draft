title: Will I ever be able to make a delicious meat sauce?
---

We are huge pasta lovers - our favorite shape is Campenelle. It reminds me of a little bugle and is just the right shape to collect any yummy additions to your dish (like a meat sauce!).

My husband can be quite picky with certain foods. He's from an Italian family and tomato sauce 

I do not think I have ever been successful with a scratch meat sauce that I liked enough to try again. My husband is quite picky when it comes to food and a homemade sauce is one thing he would really like for me to make. So I do try this every once in a while - to see if I have the chops to make something great. has suggested that I make again nor one that I liked enough to try again. If you can't tell, my husband is quite picky when it comes to food - though he isn't particularly helpful when I'm trying to decide what is missing or what could have gone wrong with a recipe attempt. I'm easier to please, but I still know what I like and what I don't like.
