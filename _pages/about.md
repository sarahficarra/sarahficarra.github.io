## Hi, I'm Sarah 

and *Better Today* chronicles my journey to become a better home cook.

Originally from New Jersey (and always a Jersey girl at heart), I currently live with my husband in California where I work full-time as an Industrial Engineer.

I love cooking and baking. But I'm only ok. Too many times have I experienced disappointing results from a recipe or something tasty took two or three times longer than it should have to make it!

I'm determined to become a better home cook so I can enjoy my kitchen-based hobbies even more.
